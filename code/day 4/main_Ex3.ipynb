       "ChatCompletionMessage(content=\"Creating a detailed illustration of a Rolls Royce or any other complex object is quite challenging and beyond the scope of TikZ's intended use. TikZ is a LaTeX package that excels at creating mathematical and simple diagrams. However, I can provide you with a simple representation of a car that you can use as a starting point. You can then modify it to add more details that are characteristic of a Rolls Royce.\\n\\nHere's a basic example of a car in TikZ:\\n\\n```latex\\n\\\\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}\\n\\\\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric}\\n\\n\\\\begin{document}\\n\\\\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.75,transform shape]\\n\\n% Car body\\n\\\\draw[fill=gray!60!white] (0,0) -- (1,0) -- (1.5,0.5) -- (4.5,0.5) -- (5,0) -- (6,0) -- (6,0.75) -- (5.5,1.25) -- (0.5,1.25) -- (0,0.75) -- cycle;\\n\\n% Windows\\n\\\\draw[fill=white] (1.75,0.75) rectangle (2.75,1.1);\\n\\\\draw[fill=white] (3.25,0.75) rectangle (4.25,1.1);\\n\\n% Wheels\\n\\\\draw[fill=black] (1.5,0) circle (0.5);\\n\\\\draw[fill=black] (4.5,0) circle (0.5);\\n\\n\\\\end{tikzpicture}\\n\\\\end{document}\\n```\\n\\nThis code will produce a simple car shape with a body, windows, and wheels. To make it look more like a Rolls Royce, you would need to add specific details such as the iconic grille, the Spirit of Ecstasy ornament, and the distinctive body shape. However, this would require a lot of custom work and artistic skill in TikZ, which is typically not used for such detailed illustrations.\\n\\nIf you're looking to create a detailed illustration of a Rolls Royce, you might want to consider using a vector graphics editor like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape, which are better suited for this kind of work. TikZ is more appropriate for diagrams, charts, and simpler shapes.\", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)"
